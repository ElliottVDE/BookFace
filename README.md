# About The Project

BookFace is a full-stack social media web application built for learning and gaining hands-on experience in modern web development. It enables users to connect, share, and interact—similar to a simplified version of popular social networking platforms.

Built by a team of CMU Computer Science graduates as a capstone learning project.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack
BookFace is built using the MERN stack, a popular combination of technologies for full-stack JavaScript development:

MongoDB – A NoSQL document-based database used to store user data, posts, comments, and relationships.

Express.js – A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework for building the backend API and routing.

React.js – A powerful frontend library used for building dynamic user interfaces and managing client-side state.

Node.js – A JavaScript runtime that powers the backend server and connects all other components together.
